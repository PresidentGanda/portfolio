        <h3 class="homeText">I'm a Senior at Pike High School with a background in Java Script, HTML, and CSS.
            I aspire to be a software developer and have taken multiple AP/DC classes
            to learn about coding, such as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A, and DC Software Development.
            In school, I also enjoy taking math classes and just finished AP Calculus AB.
            Outside of coding and computing my passion is playing soccer. I just recently won my league
            and spent most of the season as the team's captain. Another fact about me is that I love sushi.</h3>

                app that senses the hydration levels of the soil around your plant. This app allows the
                user to see whether their plant is dry even when they aren't home and has a feature that 
                moves the stopper for a set amount of time and releases water into pot. I made this app and 
                prototype with the help of a partner on particle IDE and VS code.

            <h3 class="caseText2">Thumper Jumper: <br><br> Thumper Jumper is a vertical parkour game that revolves
            around Bob, a fly with his wings broken. One morning, he's late for work at the fly factory and decides
            to take a shortcut up to his floor in order to try and get there before his boss notices. On his way
            up he encounters frogs that stop him from going up and when he reaches the top Boss Man tells him
            to get to work. I also made the code for this game mostly with Java Script but I also used HTML and CSS. </h3>
            <h3 class="caseText3">Choose Your Own Adventure: <br><br> This choose your own adventure is about
            waking up on a wednesday morning with a weird feeling in your stomach. The options either lead you to going
            to school or staying up. In the end the ceiling in your room collapses, and if you decide to stay in your bed
            you get hit. I made this code with a lot of HTML and Java Script to determine what text pops up when you click
            the buttons.</h3>
            <h3 class="caseText4">Buzz Feed Quiz:<br><br> This quiz uses a combination of questions to determine which

            is chosen. At the end it adds up the total count for each and determines which option has the largest
            sum to reveal the image of the character that fits the user.</h3>
